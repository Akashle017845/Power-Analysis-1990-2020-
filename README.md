## World Energy Analysis (1990-2020) Dashboard (Interactive Dashboard creation using Power BI)

# Project Objective
The World Energy Analysis project aims to create a comprehensive energy report for the period 1990-2020. This enables policymakers, energy analysts, and researchers to understand global energy trends, renewable adoption patterns, and emissions trajectories to make informed decisions for sustainable energy planning through 2025 and beyond.

# Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/Akashle017845/Power-Analysis-1990-2020-/blob/main/Energy.xlsx">Dataset</a>

# Questions (KPIs)

- Compare electricity production growth vs renewable energy adoption over time?

- Which regions lead in renewable energy share and wind/solar production?

- What are the coal production and consumption patterns by region?

- Which countries are the top energy producers globally?

- Analyze the relationship between regions and their coal utilization rates/

- Which regions contribute maximum to crude oil production?

- What are the CO₂ emission trends and intensity patterns?

- Track oil dependency rates across different regions?

- Percentage of renewables vs total electricity production?

# Process

- Verified data for missing values, anomalies, and inconsistencies across energy datasets
- Ensured data consistency with respect to units (TWh, Mt, MtCO₂), formats, and regional classifications
- Created comprehensive visualizations addressing each research question
- Integrated all charts into a cohesive dashboard with interactive slicers for dynamic filtering
- Applied consistent color schemes and annotations for clarity and impact
