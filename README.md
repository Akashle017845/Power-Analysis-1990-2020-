## World Energy Analysis (1990-2020) Dashboard (Interactive Dashboard creation using Power BI)

# Project Objective
The World Energy Analysis project aims to create a comprehensive energy report for the period 1990-2020. This enables policymakers, energy analysts, and researchers to understand global energy trends, renewable adoption patterns, and emissions trajectories to make informed decisions for sustainable energy planning through 2025 and beyond.
